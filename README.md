# Py-Terminal
This is a simple Python program meant to recreate a console, like the Windows command line or the Linux Terminal. It is very limited, and I have put all the code files I am working on, and code3 is the most stable, as far as I know. Some files may be missing, and I will fix this in the future.
# Running
Clone the repository and run "code.py", "code2.py", or "code3.py". These are buggy and may not run as expected!
